# Andersons Creek Primary School website

This is the Git respository for the website of Andersons Creek Primary School.

The design is based on [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) and the [Front theme](https://themes.getbootstrap.com/product/front-multipurpose-responsive-template/).

The site is built as a static site by [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) and hosted by [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/). Content editing is either done manually using a text editor or via [Forestry](https://forestry.io/) in a web browser. The site is automatically rebuilt when content is saved in Forestry and around midnight each night to keep the news and events dates current.
