As proud as we are of our teaching staff and facilities, there is another vitally important part of our community: our parents and carers.

Without their help, it would be impossible to provide the opportunities and facilities that we do and we encourage you to become involved with the school community.

Interest and involvement in a childâ€™s learning are vitally important factors for their success, so participating in our school community is be good for the school, you, and most importantly your child. It will help foster their sense of school and community belonging and contribute to their social development.

There's something for everyone and the more you can contribute to the school community, the more you and your child will get back.

## School Council

The [School Council](/our-school/school-council/ "School Council") is a body made up of parents and Department of Education and Training representatives that helps administer and establish the broad direction and vision of the school.

Elections take place early in term 1 and councillors are elected for a period of two years with meetings taking place roughly twice per term.

If you would like to have input into how the school is run, joining the council is a great way to do it.

## Working bees

Each term we hold a working bee and families are invited to attend to help keep our school grounds in good shape. Duties typically included mulching, weeding, pruning, painting and general cleaning and maintenance. Children are encouraged to attend and morning tea is served afterwards.

## Fundraisers

Our Parents and Friends group are responsible for organising fundraising events for the school. Events include Mothers' and Fathers' day stalls or breakfasts, Bop 'til you drop school discos, raffles and the Warrandyte Festival stall.

## Excursions and camps

Camps and excursions are run throughout the year and we greatly value parental support for these events. Have some fun with your child and their friends and help the school at the same time. Information about how you can help is sent out along with the notice for each event.

## Swimming carnival

The swimming carnival for grades 3-6 is the first sporting event of our school year and is held at Aquarena in Doncaster. We rely on volunteers to help with timing the events as well as general race administration.

## Cross-country

We hold our cross-country carnival at the Warrandyte Football oval and surrounding areas. It's a great day for everyone and we need our parent helpers to guide runners around the course and make sure they don't get lost!

## Athletics carnival

After cross-country, it's time for our athletics carnival with all children from Foundation to grade 6 taking part. Helpers are always needed to help with marshalling, timing races, recording results and helping out with fun and games for the younger children.

## Swimming program

Every class takes part in our swimming program during term 4 with Foundation to grade 4 having a series of swimming lessons while our grades 5 and 6 have a Surf Day at Phillip Island. Notices are sent home early in term 4 with information on parent helper requirements.
