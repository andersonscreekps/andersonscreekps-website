I strongly urge all families to ensure their fire plans are up to date and that you enact your fire plan when you feel your family's safety is at risk, even if a school closure has not been announced.

We have recently updated the ACPS Emergency Management Plan as required each year.

To further improve our emergency procedures we have created an Authority to Collect form which provides you with the opportunity to nominate up to three adults to collect your child from school in the event of a serious emergency such as a bushfire. This was distributed via the Family Pack in the last week of term 4, 2018. 

Thank you to the families who have already returned these forms.
