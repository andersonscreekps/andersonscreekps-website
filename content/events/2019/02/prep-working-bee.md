Bring your rakes, shovels, gardening tools, buckets and wheelbarrows for spreading mulch and brooms for sweeping pathways. A blower vac will take the elbow work out of sweeping so bring that along if you have one. We will also be painting, clearing pits and maintaining our gardens. Well finish off with light refreshments. This is a great opportunity to meet other families. Looking forward to seeing you there as many hands make light work. 

Please note: Parents who have paid the $75 Working Bee levy who attend a working bee during 2019, will receive one $75 credit voucher which can be used towards payment of excursions, camps and school fees.
