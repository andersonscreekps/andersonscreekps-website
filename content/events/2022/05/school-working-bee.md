Our top priorities will be spreading mulch to maintain the safety standards of our playgrounds and replenishing the sand levels in the sandpit outside the prep classroom.

Other jobs on the list include external cleaning doors/windows/entry to the theatre, repainting the hand rail around the deck of the 3/4 and 5/6 rooms and cleaning the entrance of the library.&nbsp;

As always, we will provide some equipment, however, any additional equipment (clearly labelled) you can bring makes the morning a bit easier.

We will finish the morning with a light morning tea to say thank-you to all our helpers.
