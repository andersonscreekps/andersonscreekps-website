We pride ourselves for offering a curriculum that helps students meet their full potential.

Using the Victorian Essential Learning Standards as a framework, we recognise that the three components of any curriculum necessary to enable students to meet the demands of a modern, globalised world are:

* the processes of physical, personal and social development and growth;
* the branches of learning reflected in the traditional disciplines (such as literacy and numeracy);
* the interdisciplinary capacities needed for effective functioning within and beyond school (Communication, Design, Creativity and Technology, Information and Communications Technology and Thinking Processes).

Our curriculum includes:

* [Values education](values-education/ "Values education")
* [Physical education](physical-education/ "Physical education")
* ICT
* Library
* Literacy
* LOTE
* Numeracy
* Performing Arts
* Science
* Sustainability
* Visual Arts
* Assessment
