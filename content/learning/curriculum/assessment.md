**_Assessment works best when it is ongoing rather than at one point in time._**

Student learning is best fostered when assessment involves a linked series of activities undertaken over time, so that progress is monitored towards the intended course goals and the achievement of relevant standards.

## NAPLAN

* In 2008, the National Assessment Program - Literacy and Numeracy (NAPLAN) commenced in Australian schools.
* Every year, all students in Years 3, 5, 7 and 9 are assessed on the same days using national tests in Reading, Writing, Language Conventions (Spelling, Grammar and Punctuation) and Numeracy.

## Student Learning Diaries (SLD's)

At Anderson's Creek when planning activities and managing assessment, teachers always ensure that assessment is based on a variety of tasks and is inclusive of the learning needs of all students. Multiple sources of information are used to make judgments about specific skills and depth of understanding. Assessment tasks are continually developed with the goals and objectives of the unit in mind and reflect the learning objectives outlined. These sources include;

* self assessment and reflection
* group assessment
* portfolios
* learning journals
* observations
* presentations
* demonstrations
* peer evaluations.

At Anderson's Creek you will see a full range of these types of assessment taking place at any one time throughout a Unit of Work.

At the end of each Semester a snapshot of these assessment tasks are sent home for you to go through with your child. Your child's SLD is a positive and important part of your child's everyday assessment.
