Anderson’s Creek Primary School is a leading school in **Information and Communications Technology** (ICT) and it is an integral part of our curriculum. Our ICT resources are used to enrich and enhance student learning experiences.

Students at Anderson’s Creek Primary School will spend at least three lessons per week in one of our many computer labs. Adding to this, every classroom is equipped with its own PC.   
  
Students leaving Anderson’s Creek Primary School at the end of Grade 6 are experienced and proficient in the use of Microsoft Office programs like Word, Publisher, PowerPoint and Visio. They also use Adobe Flash MX to create movies and interactive shows and Microsoft Expression to create electronic learning diaries and websites.

Anderson’s Creek Primary School is equipped with four computer labs and interactive whiteboards are installed in more than half of our classrooms. Students also have access to abundant ICT resources such as Flip cameras, digital cameras, projectors and scanners. We have a ratio of almost one computer for every two students.

Our ICT curriculum is divided into three dimensions which use ICT for visualising thinking, creating and communicating. The knowledge, skills and behaviours identified for this domain enable students to:

* develop new thinking and learning skills that produce creative and innovative insights
* develop more productive ways of working and solving problems individually and collaboratively
* create information products that demonstrate their understanding of concepts, issues, relationships and processes
* understand the implications of the use of ICT and their social and ethical responsibilities as users of ICT
