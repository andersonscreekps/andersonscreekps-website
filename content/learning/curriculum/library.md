The library is a fabulous, resourceful space that continues to evolve into a stimulating and creative place to further a love of books and reading. It is well stocked with a wide range of picture story, fiction and non-fiction books displayed in a child friendly way.

Throughout the year the library runs competitions and supports the Young Australian Best Book Awards (YABBA) & Children’s Book Council of Australia (CBCA).

The school also participates in the Victorian Premier’s Reading Challenge (Terms 2 & 3) and book week activities (Term 3).

Every class has a library session each week where the children have an opportunity to borrow books to take home.

[The National Library of Australia](http://www.nla.gov.au/) is a great place to visit online.
