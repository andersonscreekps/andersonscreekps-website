Italian at Anderson's Creek Primary School is language program that encompasses intercultural awareness and tolerance. 

Students are involved in dynamic language learning through experiences that prompt social exchanges. The students cook, act, sing, draw, dance, write and even play sport in Italian. By participating in activities, learning Italian language has meaning and purpose.

One highlight of the program is the annual Italian Day, when students have the opportunity to embrace the spirit of internationalism and live the dolce vita just for one day.
