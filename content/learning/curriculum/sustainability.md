ACPS is participating in the **Resource Smart Schools Program** funded by Sustainability Victoria and supported by Manningham City Council and CERES.

Sustainability is an important concept that is taught across Anderson's Creek. Our students are involved in Sustainable leadership groups, rubbish-free lunches, gardening and curriculum activities within all grade levels that promote sustainability.

## Current Initiatives

### Sustainability Leadership team

Our Grade 4- 6 students have the opportunity to be involved in a Sustainability leadership team, ‘ACPS Green Thumbs’, who meet regularly to discuss sustainability initiatives and ensure the ongoing success of our current sustainable practices. They also provide regular updates to the school community through our weekly whole-school assembly.

### Rubbish Free Lunch

Wednesday is our official “Rubbish-free lunch” day when students are encouraged to bring their lunch in re-usable packaging only (eg lunch boxes, containers). The class with the least rubbish receives the well-sought-after ‘Rubbish bin’ trophy to proudly display for their week as winners.

### Recycling Stations

At ACPS we have set up recycling stations including plastic, paper and compost bins in our classrooms (including the staffroom). This is program is monitored and run by our Sustainability Leadership team. Our Sustainability leaders speak at some of the school assemblies about sustainability.
