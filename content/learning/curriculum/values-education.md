## School wide values

Anderson's Creek promotes school-wide values of Respect, Optimism, Responsibility and Honesty.

Each class spends time at the beginning of the year developing behaviour guidelines and expectations. These are displayed so they can be referred to throughout the year. Children are also involved in setting personal learning goals which are revisited regularly.

## Circle time

At Anderson's Creek we focus on developing the Emotional Intelligence of our students through Circle Time. [Click here ](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circle_time)to find out more.

## Behaviour contracts

At the beginning of the year our students enter into Behaviour Contracts between them and the school which are designed to give clear guidelines as to the expectations their classroom teachers have of them regarding their behaviour and attitude in school, and towards their peers.

In offering them a chance to consider their behaviour and the way it affects others, and reaching an agreement on appropriate codes of conduct, students are empowered to take control of the choices they make every day.
