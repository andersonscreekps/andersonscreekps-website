The Visual and Performing Arts are effectively integrated into student experiences in Anderson Creek Primary School. The Arts program is committed to providing quality arts education through experience for all learners.

## Grade 6 Art Project

Each year the Grade 6 students create a group work of art which is permanently displayed in the school grounds.

Our arts programs allows students to learn and practice skills and behaviours that encourage out-of- the-box thinking and creative problem solving.
