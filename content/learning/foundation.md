At Andersons Creek Primary School (ACPS), your child will experience many fun and exciting new things during their first year at school.

Through a combination of structured learning, hands-on activities and an inquiry-based approach, we aim to develop social and team skills that will help your child to become a lifelong learner.

We are committed to ensuring a smooth transition into school for your child.

Commencing in Term 2, we offer the opportunity to participate in our Story Time program. These sessions are open to both 3- and 4-year-old children and involve a story, followed by an art/craft activity.

The transition program continues in Term 3 with our Bridges to Foundation sessions. These experiences will allow your child to meet other staff members and become familiar with our school environment.

The final transition sessions in Term 4 are for enrolled students. Children will have the opportunity to meet their teacher, classmates and Grade 6 buddy for the following year.

Our Buddy Program will assist your child with settling into the school routine. Knowing older students in the playground helps the Foundation (Prep) children feel happy and safe. Special buddy activities are run throughout the year.
