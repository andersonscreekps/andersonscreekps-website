One of our priorities in Grade 1 and 2 is that all children feel happy and secure. This is achieved through explicit programs and a nurturing and caring team.

The grade 1 and 2 teachers work hard to ensure that the learning environment they provide for the children is creative, engaging, supportive and productive. This contributes to the success of the children’s education and is underpinned by a differentiated curriculum where students are involved in a range of engaging, challenging and motivating activities.

These include hands-on activities, open-ended tasks that cater to their specific needs and ongoing projects through an Inquiry Approach. The Inquiry unit has been designed to foster a community of critical thinkers and collaborators.

Andersons Creek’s Early Years offers many wonderful opportunities that encourage students’ social, emotional, physical and academic development. A wide range of in-school incursions, excursions and extracurricular programs complement our school programs.

Students engage in many rich learning experiences, as individual learners and in a variety of collaborative group investigations.

In Grade 1 and 2 we teach them that people with a growth mindset believe that they can learn, change, and develop needed skills. In our _reflective_ classroom, we invite _students_ to make meaning from their experiences.

Students are encouraged to make goals throughout the year. Students become better equipped to work hard to accomplish their goals.

The students also use individual iPad technology. Literacy and Mathematics apps are incorporated into the classroom programs to provide powerful learning opportunities.

In Term 4, Specific apps such as Google Earth, Atlas and Bugs were used for our Inquiry Units, captivating our students.

Students also visit Aquarena, in Term 4, for ten sessions over two weeks to enhance their swimming skills. It is always great to see their skills develop and the enjoyment they receive from participating in this intensive two-week program with their peers.

Mini Lit and Multi Lit are school-based early literacy intervention programs that provide a second opportunity for students who, after one year at school, have not yet established effective reading and writing processes.
