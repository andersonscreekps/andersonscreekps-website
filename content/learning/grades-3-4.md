In Grade 3 & 4 (Level 3) Anderson's Creek is committed to providing students with a safe, welcoming and happy learning environment in which students are challenged and supported to achieve their full potential. Literacy and Numeracy are the key learning areas which are fundamental to students developing as confident learners.

## Literacy

### Overview

Grade 3 & 4 students work towards the Level 3 Standards in English. They speak, listen, read and write with more critical awareness, using a growing variety of text types. Student learning activities are designed to encourage the development of skills using a variety of exciting resources.

There is a strong focus on developing good speaking and listening skills through a variety of learning tasks.

### Reading

Students read an increasing range of texts including:

* imaginative texts
* chapter books
* junior novels
* poetry
* informative texts

### Spelling

Spelling is a vital part of our writing program.

Students will:

* develop their confidence in spelling of familiar words
* develop strategies to attempt more difficult words.

### Writing

Students develop confidence in writing a range of imaginative and informative texts across the curriculum. They write texts that explain, inform and express their own point of view. They are encouraged to draw on their own knowledge and use a variety of writing formats including narrative recounts and reports.

## Numeracy

Anderson's Creek provides planned learning activities across Grade 3 & 4 that develops confident learners working towards the achievement of Level 3 standards in Mathematics.

Students recognise and explore patterns in numbers and shape and increasingly use mathematical terms and symbols to describe computations, measurements and characteristics of objects.

Activities and investigations are planned to engage all our students and their mathematical learning. Students learn to recognise practical applications of mathematics in everyday life, including work, play, shopping, travel and time of day.

## Camp

A school camp is a much anticipated experience for both students and teachers.

### Overview

Grade 3 & 4 students have the opportunity to attend the CYC Camp at Phillip Island. The focus for students attending camp is the development of independence. Students are able to step outside their comfort zones and tackle a myriad of challenges designed to enhance their self-belief, self-worth and relationships with their peers. Some of these life long skills are sharing, helping, encouraging others and listening.
