At Andersons Creek Primary School, Grade 5 & 6 is a special time for your child.

They develop many skills in independent learning and critical thinking to get them ready for Secondary school. They enjoy Camp, Production, Prep Buddy Program and Inter-school Sports, just to name a few.

## Literacy

### Overview

Students in Year 5 and Year 6 build on and deepen the basic knowledge and skills related to texts and language that they developed in their early stage of schooling.

Our literacy program provides students with the opportunity to undertake structured activities in small groups with some autonomy. Under guidance, they reflect on reading, viewing, writing, speaking and listening in ways that develop considered and critical approaches to a range of texts.

### Literature Circles

Year 5 and 6 students participate in teacher-guided but ‘student-led ‘ book clubs. Students rotate through roles such as Discussion Director, Illustrator, Word Wizard, Imagery Maker to reflect on what they have read, expand language knowledge and develop leadership/ facilitating skills. Teachers rotate their time amongst groups to extend the reflective practises and discussion in order to support development in the expression of views, understanding and analytical skills.

### Spelling and Grammar

The Soundwaves spelling program is a phoneme based program that commences in Level 1. By Level 6, many students are at the stage where they are learning about etymology (word origins), suffixes and prefixes. The great thing about this program is that we can differentiate what we teach quite easily and there are plenty of support materials to provide students with practice.

### Humanities, ICT and Science

### Humanities

Humanities encompass History, Geography and Economics. Our aim is to involve students in the curriculum as much as possible while covering key ideas. When learning about Federation, for instance, students can choose to research main themes such as suffrage; the Great Depression and key figures within the movement. We run a special week of lessons to commemorate the ANZACS which culminates in the ANZAC Day Ceremony and an Expo. Other subjects include the Gold Rush; Asia; Government and Migration.

### ICT (Information and Communications Technology)

In Levels 5 and 6 students use iPads and personal computers for a range of tasks. We use a range of applications such as ‘Tellagami’, ‘Padlet’, ‘Flipagram’ and ‘BookCreator’ to present their understanding in a range of ways. Where appropriate, students have access to ebooks and Audible to help comprehension.

They produce information products that demonstrate their knowledge and skills for all areas of the curriculum.

‪ ‪Students begin to use and become familiar with computer programs such as Excel, Prezi, Wix, Publisher, Word and PowerPoint. We introduce students to coding using ‘Tynker’ and ‘Scratch’.

Andersons Creek Primary School is equipped with two computer labs and interactive whiteboards are installed in our classrooms.

### Science

We run a dynamic and engaging program in Levels 5 and 6, covering Biological, Physical, Chemical and Earth Sciences. We teach with a ‘hands on’ approach and allow students to make their own investigations where appropriate. Topics include: Solar Energy; Electricity; Space; Natural Disasters; Chemical Change and Plant and Animal Adaptations.

## Camp

### Marysville

The grade 6 students participate in two short camps over the course of the school year. The first is located in Marysville

([http://www.campmarysville.org.au](http://www.campmarysville.org.au "http://www.campmarysville.org.au")) located about an hour from school. This camp offers a range of activities designed to build resilience and develop confidence and teamwork.

Students take part in canoeing, cooking, bike riding, hiking and climbing. At night, campfires are lit and we tell stories and sing songs.

On returning to school, students design a survey to give feedback to the teachers on what they thought about the camp and whether they would recommend it for future years.

### Bike Education

As part of our Bike Education program, Grade 5‘s attend a four-day Bike Education camp.

This provides students with the opportunity to put into practice the safety and skill development they have acquired during our school-based Bike Education unit.
