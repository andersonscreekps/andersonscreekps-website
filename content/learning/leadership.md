## Junior School Council

As part of students at Andersons Creek having a voice, Junior School representatives from Grade 3 to Grade 6 meet on a regular basis with the Principal and Assistant Principal.

Children are involved in decision making around whole school issues such as placement of play areas, ground improvements and extracurricular activities for all students to be involved in.

They meet with students in their classes to discuss topical issues that are then relayed to School Council and the School Leaders for implementation.

## Green Thumbs

Our Grade 5 and 6 students have the opportunity to be involved in a Sustainability leadership team, ‘ACPS Green Thumbs’, who meet regularly to discuss sustainability initiatives and ensure the ongoing success of our current sustainable practices.
