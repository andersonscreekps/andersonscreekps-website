NAPLAN is an annual assessment for all primary school students in years 3 and 5 as well as secondary school students in years 7 and 9. It tests essential skills in reading, writing, spelling, grammar and punctuation, and numeracy.

NAPLAN results are provided to schools from August to September and all students who participated in the NAPLAN tests receive an [individual report of their results](https://www.nap.edu.au/results-and-reports/student-reports "NAPLAN student reports").

Results are released in two stages.

The first stage summary is released in August and shows preliminary results at each year level nationally and broken down by state and territory.

The second stage is the full national report that includes the final results in detail.

NAPLAN reports are posted to the [National Assessment Program](https://www.nap.edu.au/ "National Assessment Program") website as they are released.
