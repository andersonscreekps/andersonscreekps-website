Sustainability is an important concept that is taught across Anderson's Creek Primary School.

## Sustainability leadership team

Our Grade 4--6 students have the opportunity to be involved in a sustainability leadership team, ‘ACPS Green Thumbs’, who meet regularly to discuss sustainability initiatives and ensure the ongoing success of our current sustainable practices. They also provide regular updates to the school community through our weekly whole-school assembly.

## Rubbish-free lunch

Wednesday is our official “Rubbish-free lunch” day when students are encouraged to bring their lunch in re-usable packaging only (e.g. lunch boxes, containers). The class with the least rubbish receives the well-sought-after ‘Rubbish bin’ trophy to proudly display for their week as winners.

## Recycling stations

We have set up recycling stations including plastic, paper and compost bins in our classrooms (including the staffroom). This is program is monitored and run by our sustainability leadership team.

## Vegetable garden and chicken house

The school has a vegetable garden as well as worm farms and compost bins. We also have a chicken house ("Cluckingham Palace") inhabited by some of our feathery friends.
