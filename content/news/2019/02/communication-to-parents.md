This year we will again conduct Information Nights prior to the Meet the Teacher night to avoid doubling up on information and to make the one on one meeting with your child’s teacher more meaningful. Please contact your child’s teacher prior to this date should you have any information that cannot wait to be shared.

You will continue to receive Team Level and Specialists’ Newsletters which will go out Week 2 of each term. These newsletters will have information specific to your child’s year level.
