description = "On Wednesday 13 February we held our first practice fire drill for the year. It was in response to the scenario event of a bushfire.  Our safer place is the Performing Arts Centre."
title = "Fire drill"

We ran through the drill twice to ensure all aspects of our Emergency Management Plan were enacted correctly. The stu- dents did a fantastic job of following instructions and asked great questions during the discussions at the end of the drill. We managed to assemble in the theatre in a record time of 4 1⁄2 minutes. Well done!!!

I strongly urge all families to ensure their fire plans are up to date and that you enact your fire plan when you feel your family’s safety is at risk, even if a school closure has not been announced.
