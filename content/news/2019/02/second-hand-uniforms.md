title = "Second-hand uniforms"

The proceeds go to the schoolâ€™s fund, however the primary focus is to provide families the opportunity to purchase second-hand uniforms, for a fraction of the cost. The Second-Hand uniform shop also assists families who may be experiencing hardship.

Uniforms should be clean and in fair condition. Please drop your unwanted  uniforms to Jo at the office, at your convenience.

Thank you.
