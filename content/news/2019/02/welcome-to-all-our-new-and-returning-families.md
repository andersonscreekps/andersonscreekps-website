This week all students have been involved in a “Start-Up” Program where getting to know each other, school values, classroom norms and expectations have been the focus. Together, teachers and their students will set classroom norms and discuss school-wide behaviour goals. This program will continue next week.

The ACPS school Rules/Behaviour agreement will be sent home today for students to discuss with their parents and for both parents and students to sign and return to the classroom teacher. This agreement is a part of our Student Engagement Policy which can be found on the school website at [http://www.andersonscreekps.vic.edu.au/](http://www.andersonscreekps.vic.edu.au/ "http://www.andersonscreekps.vic.edu.au/"). 

It is the partnership of support between home and school that will make the contract meaningful to the student and relevant for their learning in 2019.
