Thank you to all the families who donated goods for our Tasty Treat sale today. We had an amazing range of treats - such variety that the children were momentarily (but only momentarily!) frozen by choice paralysis.

Thank you also to Alannah, Erin, James and Oscar from 5/6B who helped me with everything including set-up, sales, money counting and cleaning up afterwards.

We raised nearly $500 for the school and to see the gigantic smiles on the children was worth at least that much again.
