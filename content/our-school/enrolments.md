## Enrolling your child

* Proof of date of birth via a birth certificate or passport.
* A certificate of vaccination - these can be obtained from [The Australian Childood Immunisation Register](https://www.servicesaustralia.gov.au/individuals/services/medicare/australian-immunisation-register/how-get-immunisation-history-statement "ACIR") or your vaccination provider.

As per state law, children in Victoria must attend school from the age of 6 and children being enrolled in Foundation must be turning 5 on or before April 30 of the year that they start school.

## Preparing for school

Starting school is a big change for a child (as well as parents and carers). You can help your child prepare for school by helping them understand what is happening and familiarising them with the school environment.

We offer a variety of programs to introduce children to our school. You can find details of these on our [Foundation page](/learning/foundation/ "Foundation"). The Victorian Government also has a [guide to starting primary school ](https://www.vic.gov.au/starting-primary-school-guide "Starting primary school guide")and a [Transition to school information sheet](https://www.education.vic.gov.au/Documents/childhood/professionals/learning/translations/English-information-sheet-transition-to-school.pdf "Transition to school information sheet") that you may find helpful.
