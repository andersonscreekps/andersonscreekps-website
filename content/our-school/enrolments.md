## Preparing for school

Starting school is a big change for a child (as well as parents and carers). You can help you child prepare for school by helping them understand what is happening and familiarising them with the school environment.

We offer a variety of programs to introduce children to our school. You can find details of these on our [Foundation page](/learning/foundation/ "Foundation"). The Victorian Government also has a [guide to starting primary school ](https://www.vic.gov.au/starting-primary-school-guide "Starting primary school guide")that you may find helpful.
