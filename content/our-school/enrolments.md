## 2024 enrolments

Enrolments for 2024 are now being accepted.

Please [contact us](/our-school/contact-us/ "Contact us") to find out more information and to arrange a tour of our school.

## Foundation (Prep) enrolments

Our school follows the Department of Education’s [Enrolment Policy](https://www2.education.vic.gov.au/pal/enrolment/policy) for the enrolment, placement, and transfer of students.

The Department of Education has a statewide Foundation (Prep) enrolment timeline.

The timeline advises families when and how to enrol their child into Foundation (Prep) at a Victorian government primary school, including Andersons Creek Primary School.

You can find information and resources about the enrolment timeline at: [Enrolling in Foundation (Prep)](https://www.vic.gov.au/enrolling-foundation-prep).

## Enrolling your child

When enrolling at Anderson's Creek Primary, please provide us with:

* A completed [enrolment form](/forms/student-enrolment/ "Enrolment form"). Enrolment applications submitted after 28 July 2023 will be processed by our school as they are received, in accordance with the department’s Placement Policy.
* Proof of date of birth via a birth certificate or passport.
* A certificate of vaccination - these can be obtained from [The Australian Childood Immunisation Register](https://www.servicesaustralia.gov.au/individuals/services/medicare/australian-immunisation-register/how-get-immunisation-history-statement "ACIR") or your vaccination provider.

As per state law, children in Victoria must attend school from the age of 6 and children being enrolled in Foundation must be turning 5 on or before April 30 of the year that they start school.

## Preparing for school

Starting school is a big change for a child (as well as parents and carers). You can help your child prepare for school by helping them understand what is happening and familiarising them with the school environment.

We offer a variety of programs to introduce children to our school. You can find details of these on our [Foundation page](/learning/foundation/ "Foundation").

Please contact the school office at [andersons.creek.ps@education.vic.gov.au](mailto:andersons.creek.ps@education.vic.gov.au) or on 03 9844 2757 for more information about our transition programs.

The Victorian Government also has a [guide to starting primary school](https://www.vic.gov.au/starting-primary-school-guide "Starting primary school guide") and a [Transition to school information sheet](https://www.education.vic.gov.au/Documents/childhood/professionals/learning/translations/English-information-sheet-transition-to-school.pdf "Transition to school information sheet") that you may find helpful.

## Enrolments in years 1-6

We invite you to contact us to discuss enrolment of your child when transferring from another school into Andersons Creek Primary School.

Enrolments for students transferring from another school are processed in accordance with the department’s Placement Policy.

Further information is available on the Department of Education's website.
