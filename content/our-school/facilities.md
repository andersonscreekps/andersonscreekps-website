Andersons Creek Primary School is centred on two hexagon-shaped buildings that house open-planned classrooms opening onto shared workspaces. Another hexagon houses our offices and performing arts theatre.

Surrounding these buildings are our outdoor facilities as well as additional smaller classroom buildings and an indoor basketball stadium.

## Performing arts theatre

Our performing arts theatre seats 440 people and has a fully equipped stage. This facility is used by students in the performing arts program and hosts our weekly assemblies, musical productions and other whole-school events.

The theatre is available for either regular or occasional hire for community and business groups. Please contact our office for more information.

## Learning shack

Children absorb information in different ways and enjoy a variety of different learning environments. Our learning shack serves as an outdoor classroom in good weather and it's also a place for children who prefer a quieter style of play during recess and lunchtime.

## Children's garden and chook house

The children's garden has a range of raised garden beds, worm and compost farms, a garden shed and a chook shed that houses our feathered friends.

## Synthetic oval

We have a large synthetic oval with a perimeter running track and central cricket pitch. The oval had a major refurbishment and resurfacing in 2020 and is used by students at recess and lunchtime and for their physical education classes. It is also used by local sporting clubs outside of school hours.

## Indoor basketball stadium

The indoor basketball stadium is available for use during school hours and can be configured for basketball, netball, volleyball, badminton as well as open space.

Outside of school hours, the stadium is run as the [Warrandyte Sports Centre](https://manningham.ymca.org.au/stadiums/warrandyte-sports-centre "Warrandyte Sports Centre") by Manningham Council.
