It is my absolute privilege to be at Andersons Creek Primary School (ACPS) in the role of Acting Principal. I have had a long association with the school since 1997.

Our school provides an engaging, comprehensive program. We aim to create a safe and nurturing environment that is built on positive relationships. We develop the whole student - academically, emotionally and socially.

Our community is wonderful and provides the opportunity for active participation of all members of the school community and is committed to working effectively together, to ensure an inclusive environment within which every learner feels safe, valued and understood.

We live by our motto: “Learning through the community”. Our school values are Respect, Responsibility, Optimism and Honesty, with kindness always being at the forefront of all that we do!

There is a strong focus on academic excellence as well as opportunities for students to explore new passions and become curious. confident learners.

All our staff have a shared goal of wanting to make a positive difference (social, emotional and academic) to every child at ACPS. Our students are motivated learners and we are fortunate to have supportive, committed families who are active participants in their child’s learning journey.

Students at ACPS participate in a wide range of inclusive and engaging curriculum activities, sporting and recreational programs as well as performing and visual arts.

Students have the opportunity to be part of the Junior School Council, “Green Thumbs” – our sustainability group, school camps, inter-school sport, other sporting opportunities and lego lunch club.

Students also participate in Italian lessons with a dedicated Italian language teacher as part of our Specialist Program.

We have a strong school focus on School Wide Positive Behaviours and well-being. We encourage all students to be their best!

We welcome visitors to Andersons Creek Primary School and invite you to come on a tour with our Grade 6 Captains. Our Pre-prep to Prep Transition program is very comprehensive. 

I look forward to meeting you personally and we can be contacted on 9844 2757.
