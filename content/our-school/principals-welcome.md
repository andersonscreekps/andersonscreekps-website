As Principal at Andersons Creek Primary School, I’m proud to lead a school where student achievement and wellbeing are the top priorities and parent participation is highly valued.

We aim to create a safe and nurturing, yet challenging environment that is built on positive relationships. We develop the whole student – emotionally, socially and academically. We care for, and appreciate, each of our students as the unique individuals that they are, each of them with their own distinct talents, interests and needs.

At Andersons Creek Primary School, students develop responsibility for their own behaviour and the choices they make, and also a communal responsibility to assist their peers to do the same.

Andersons Creek Primary School’s motto is *Learning through the Community. We are* a friendly, vibrant, community-minded school, whose decisions always put our students first. We are very keen to involve our community in our learning and to develop true partnerships that value each student.

We have a wonderful school, student body and staff and I encourage you to get in touch to book a tour so you can experience it for yourself.

Sue Dyos, Principal
