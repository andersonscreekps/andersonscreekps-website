It is my pleasure to introduce myself as the Principal of Andersons Creek Primary School, a place where we couple community connection with a high-quality, comprehensive and holistic education.

As a school, we are proud to be known for our commitment to student excellence and achievement, and our capacity to cater for the individual growth of all our students, ensuring their social, emotional and academic development. 

We have a strong commitment to developing the skills our students need to flourish in their schooling and thrive in their future as active, global citizens. Our strong focus on literacy and numeracy is complemented with rich integrated learning programs centred around developing 21st century skills such as critical thinking, problem solving, creativity, collaboration, communication, technology, leadership and emotional intelligence.

We offer a range of academic, sporting, artistic, and cultural programs that cater to the diverse needs and interests of our students. We believe that every student has the potential to succeed, and we are committed to helping them achieve their goals.

We pride ourselves on our implementation of a School Wide Positive Behaviour framework, to provide our students with a positive, safe, supportive and effective learning environment every day. Our values of respect, responsibility, honesty and optimism are the foundations of how we interact with each other and are evident in all we do.

We believe that education should be a collaborative effort between students, staff, parents, and the wider community, and we are committed to fostering strong partnerships that empower student learning and wellbeing. 

Andersons Creek Primary School is a wonderful school community filled with aspirant and well-rounded students, supportive families and dedicated staff. It is my privilege to lead our school community and work to ensure that Andersons Creek Primary School continues to be a place where every child can thrive.

As Principal, my door is always open for current and prospective families. I warmly welcome any new families considering our school to contact me to arrange a tour of our facilities and to learn more about or school. 

Kind Regards,

Daniel Webber
