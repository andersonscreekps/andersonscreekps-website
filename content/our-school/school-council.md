## About School Councils

All school councils in Victoria operate under the Education and Training Reform Act 2006.

Each school council is established by an Order of the Minister for Education, which specifies:

* membership
* size and configuration
* objectives and powers
* functions and accountabilities
* role of the executive officer who is the principal.

More information on the roles and responsibilities of school councils can be found at [https://www.education.vic.gov.au/school/teachers/management/community/Pages/schoolcouncilsfunction.aspx](https://www.education.vic.gov.au/school/teachers/management/community/Pages/schoolcouncilsfunction.aspx "https://www.education.vic.gov.au/school/teachers/management/community/Pages/schoolcouncilsfunction.aspx").
