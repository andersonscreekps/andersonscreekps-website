A massive thank-you to the Warrandyte Festival Committee for all their hard work, and well done to all the schools, community organisations and everyone else involved in organising and running the stalls and events at the festival.

We certainly "Celebrate(d): Together Again" and we can't wait to see everyone back for more in 2023\!
