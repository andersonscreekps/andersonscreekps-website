summary: >-
  Today we held our school cross-country at the Warrandyte Reserve. It was
  wonderful to enjoy a whole-school activity and we were blessed with a
  beautiful day after postponing the event due to bad weather last week.

Everyone had a run, even our prep students who ran a lap of the oval while being cheered on by the rest of the school. We finished the day with some fun activities including egg-and-spoon races, tunnel-ball and three-legged races.

Those who finished in the top 10 in the senior races will be off to compete in the Templestowe District Cross Country carnival at Ruffey Lake Park on Tuesday, May 18.
